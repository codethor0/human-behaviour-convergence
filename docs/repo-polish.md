# Repository Polish Checklist

## Update repository description
- Navigate to GitHub → repository home → **About** (right sidebar) → click the pencil icon.
- Paste the description:
  > Population-scale behavioral forecasting with synthetic data: centaur models, multimodal fusion, and ethics-first evaluation.
- Ensure the “Include in home page” checkbox is ticked.

## Add discoverability topics
- In the same **About** panel, add the following topics (comma-separated):
  `human-behaviour, human-behavior, forecasting, population-modeling, multimodal, privacy, ethics, satellite-imagery, timeseries, fastapi, nextjs`
- Save changes; confirm topics render as clickable badges.

## Upload social preview
- Go to **Settings → General → Social preview**.
- Click “Edit” and upload `assets/social-preview.svg` (or the PNG variant if preferred).
- Save and verify the preview displays the latest branding.

Once these steps are complete, the repository landing page will align with the new launch messaging and improve GitHub topic discoverability.

# Behaviour Convergence Explorer v0.1.0

*Release date: TBD (v0.1.0 tag)*

## Highlights
- End-to-end synthetic behavioural forecasting stack: FastAPI backend, static Explorer, and packaging for `pip install -e .`.
- Deterministic `/api/forecast` endpoint and cache observability via `/api/status` + `/api/cache/status`.
- One-command bootstrap script (`./scripts/dev`) that installs dependencies, runs tests, launches the API, and opens the Explorer page.

## API & backend
- Added synthetic metadata responses to `/api/status` and deterministic seed generation for `/api/forecast`.
- Shared forecasting utility (`hbc.forecasting.generate_synthetic_forecast`) powers both API and CLI.
- Expanded test coverage (`tests/test_api_backend.py`, `tests/test_cli.py`) to cover new endpoints and edge cases.

## Tooling & packaging
- Introduced `pyproject.toml` with `hbc-cli` console entrypoint and optional `dev` extras.
- Multi-stage Dockerfile builds minimal runtime image running `uvicorn app.main:app`.
- Repository now enforces branch protection and pre-commit hooks for markdown/code hygiene.

## Documentation
- README refreshed with badge strip, quick start, cloud launch badges, architecture summary, and contributing guidance.
- Added Explorer page (`docs/index.html`), model/data card (`docs/model-data-card.md`), repo polish checklist, and project rationale blog post.
- Seeded “good first issues” draft list for community onboarding.

## Assets & release metadata
- Social preview artwork lives in `assets/` and should be uploaded during release.
- Zenodo DOI placeholder: update the README badge and this document once DOI is minted.
- Changelog: see [`CHANGELOG.md`](../../CHANGELOG.md) for the detailed list of commits merged into this release.

## Upgrade notes
- Update local clones: `git pull && ./scripts/dev --reset` to recreate the virtualenv with the packaging changes.
- Consumers of the CLI should reinstall via `pip install -e .` after pulling to pick up the new entrypoint.

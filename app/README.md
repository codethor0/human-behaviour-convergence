# Behaviour Convergence Explorer

> Application workspace for turning the research repo into an interactive experience.

## Structure (planned)

```
app/
├── frontend/   # Next.js (React + TypeScript)
└── backend/    # FastAPI (Python)
```

## Setup

This folder currently contains planning materials only. Scaffolding will be added in milestone `app-v0.1`:

1. `frontend/` — Next.js bootstrap with pnpm.
2. `backend/` — FastAPI project with Poetry/uv.
3. Shared config (ESLint, Prettier, Makefile) at `app/` root.

Refer to [../docs/app-plan.md](../docs/app-plan.md) for detailed roadmap.

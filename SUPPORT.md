# Support

This repository is documentation-focused. If you need help:

- Check the `README.md` for usage and links.
- Open an issue and pick the most appropriate template (bug or feature request). Describe what you’re trying to do and include links or screenshots if relevant.

For small edits, you can also open a PR directly—CI will re-render the diagram for you.

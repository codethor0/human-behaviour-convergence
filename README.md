## 🎯 What is this?

This project demonstrates **population-scale behavioural forecasting** using a three-layer architecture: 5.6B online training samples, 2.8B offline targets acquired via satellite & ground imagery, and 8.4B inference endpoints. The system combines centaur AI models, multi-modal fusion pipelines, and real-time prediction to forecast macro-behavioural states at unprecedented scale.

**Status:** Proof-of-concept (v0.1) — research artifact  
**Paper:** Under review  
**Data:** Synthetic sample (1% slice) available; full dataset under restricted access  
**Roadmap:** [GitHub Milestones](https://github.com/codethor0/human-behaviour-convergence/milestones)

## 🛠️ Development

- **Prerequisites:** Python 3.10+, Node 20 (for diagram rendering)
- **Setup:**
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/codethor0/human-behaviour-convergence.git
  cd human-behaviour-convergence
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # for testing
  ```
- **Run tests:**
  ```bash
  pytest tests/ --cov
  ```

## 🧭 Application Roadmap

We are building **Behaviour Convergence Explorer**, an interactive web application that surfaces the forecasting pipeline, synthetic results, and ethical guardrails.

- 📄 Architecture & feature plan: [docs/app-plan.md](./docs/app-plan.md)
- 🎯 Current milestone: `app-v0.1` — scaffold Next.js + FastAPI workspace, CI, and interactive diagram
- 🧩 Tech stack preview: Next.js (TypeScript), Tailwind, FastAPI, Pandas, Vercel/Render
- 🛡️ Principles: synthetic data only, transparent ethics, extensible APIs

Contributions welcome! Open an issue with the label `app` to collaborate on frontend, backend, or UX tasks.

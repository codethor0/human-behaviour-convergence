# Branch Cleanup Notes

This file documents branch cleanup decisions.

## Branch Status (as of workflow consolidation)

- **master**: Default branch, actively maintained
- **main**: Duplicate default branch, should be deleted after confirming no unique commits
- **feat/public-layer**: Feature branch, should be merged or deleted if obsolete

## Cleanup Actions

1. Confirm main branch has no unique commits beyond master
2. Delete main branch after verification: `git push origin --delete main`
3. Evaluate feat/public-layer: merge useful changes to master, then delete
4. Final state: Only master branch remains as default
